The Reimbursement Account has to be in the same order as your Salary Savings Account. In case your Salary savings account is a joint account then a separate introduction is not required and you only need to add the name in the (Account Opening Document) AOD.
Your existing Debit Card will be linked to both accounts. Any additional card will be charged at the regular rates. You will be able to select either account to transact at HDFC Bank ATMs. At other VISA/PLUS ATMs (Other Bank’s ATMs) you may or may not have access to both accounts. When such an option is unavailable, you can only access your salary account. If you are a VISA Electron Debit Cardholder you can access only your Salary Account at merchant locations for transactions and not your Reimbursement Account. If you are a Maestro Debit Cardholder may be able to select between your Salary Account and Reimbursement Account at merchant locations.
The Reimbursement Account is value added benefit given to the salary account holder and hence is a non-interest bearing account.
A Reimbursement Account enables you to separate your regular monthly salary from the monthly reimbursements you receive from your company. This helps you track reimbursements separately.
The features & benefits on the Reimbursement account are as follows: Click Here for features & benefits on the Reimbursement account.

This is a service designed only for remitting Indian Rupees within India.
E-Monies NEFT has no restrictions, because it’s based on a centralized network. That’s not the case for the RBI-EFT system, which is confined to just 15 centres.
To use this service, you should provide the beneficiary details (name and account number), and the name and IFSC of the beneficiary bank branch.
Your funds will be returned to your account if they are not credited.
E-Monies NEFT is an electronic payment system, used to transfer funds to any part of India. It works on ‘net settlement’, unlike RTGS that works on ‘gross settlement’, and EFT which is restricted to only 15 centres.
NEFT transactions on NetBanking are charged as below: Amounts up to Rs. 10,000 - Rs.2.5 (exclusive of taxes) per transaction Amounts from Rs.10,001 to Rs.1 lakh - Rs. 5 (exclusive of taxes) per transaction Amounts above Rs. 1 lakh up to Rs. 2 lakh - Rs. 15 (exclusive of taxes) per transactionAmounts above Rs.2 lakh – Rs.25 (exclusive of taxes) per transaction View more
Just ask your beneficiary to get the IFSC from his or her branch. They can also find it in their cheque book - the IFSC is in the cheque leaf.
NEFT is an electronic fund transfer system that operates on a deferred net settlement (DNS) basis, which settles transactions in batches. In DNS, the settlement takes place at a definite time and all transactions are held up till that instant. Any transaction initiated after a designated settlement time will have to wait till the next designated settlement time. RTGS is different because transactions are processed continuously. View more
'RTGS' stands for 'Real Time Gross Settlement'. The RTGS system is a funds transfer mechanism where transfer of money takes place from one bank to another on a 'real time' and on a 'gross' basis. This is the fastest possible money transfer system through banking channels. 'Real time' means no waiting period; transactions are settled as soon as they are processed. 'Gross settlement' means the transaction is finalized on its own, without it being bunched with any other transaction. View more
The RTGS system has been designed for large value transactions. The minimum amount to be remitted through RTGS is Rs. 2 Lakhs. There is no upper ceiling for RTGS transactions. The only change to this is RTGS transactions done through NetBanking, when the maximum amount of funds that can be transferred per Customer ID per day is Rs. 10 Lakhs. View more
When using RTGS Funds Transfers, there are a few essential details to provide: Amount to be remitted Account number from where the funds will be debited Name of the beneficiary bank, and the name of the beneficiary customer Account number of the beneficiary customer Sender to receiver information, if there is one The IFSC code of the receiving branch View more
Effective 15 November, 2010; RTGS transactions on NetBanking are charged as below : Rs. 2 lac to Rs. 5 lac - Rs. 25 (inclusive of taxes) per transaction Above Rs. 5 lac - Rs. 50 (inclusive of taxes) per transaction Note: RTGS transfers can be done for amounts exceeding Rs. 2,00,000 only whereas for NEFT there are no such amount restrictions.
Real-time means that beneficiary branches are expected to receive the funds as soon as they are transferred by the remitting bank. The beneficiary bank must credit the beneficiary's account within 30 minutes of receiving the funds transfer message.
With RTGS, the receiving bank should credit the account of the beneficiary instantly. If for some reason the money cannot be credited, the receiving bank has to return the money to the remitting bank within 1 hour. As soon as the money is returned, the original debit entry in the customer's account is reversed.]

A large part of the success of Mutual Funds is also the advantages they offer in terms of diversification, professional management and liquidity. Power of Compounding: The longer the period of your investment, the more wealth you can accumulate because of the power of compounding. That’s why it makes sense to start investing early. Quite simply, the incremental returns that you earn on your principal, plus accrued gains, is compounded. Rupee Cost Averaging: Most investors want to buy stocks when the prices are low and sell them when the prices are high. But timing the market is time consuming and risky. A more successful investment strategy is to adopt a method called Rupee Cost Averaging. By investing in an SIP you end up buying more units when the price is low and less when the price is high. To set up an SIP, walk in to your nearest HDFC Bank branch or invest through an Investment Services Account. View more

The current scenario in the equity market is dominated by negative sentiment, which has led to fundamentals being ignored. This scenario has created volatility in the markets and uncertainty of future outlook. The prudent way to invest in this scenario is to benefit from the volatility and this can be done by investing through SIP’s. A monthly SIP helps in averaging out the cost of purchase and benefit from the power of compounding. It also helps in creating wealth over a longer time period. The current investment scenario is still dominated by negative sentiment. This creates volatility in the markets due to confused minds of the investors. Such volatility makes it difficult to capture the market movements and most people end up losing money with the intention of timing the markets. Also investing a lump sum in one shot might lead you to miss out on market opportunities. The tool to beat such a scenario is investing through a Systematic Investment Plan.
